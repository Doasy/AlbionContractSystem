# Albion Trade Tickets

A ticket-receiver [webpage](https://mrg20.github.io/AlbionContractSystem/) for users and guilds. Want a bounty guild to hunt your enemy? Want guardians to protect you while gathering? Are you starting a guild oriented in guarding 

## Anti cheat system

This web page will have a list of cheaters (guilds or players), so everyone is going to know if you cheat.

## Anonymous clientele

When a user posts a ticket it will be anonymous until the contract begins. People will not see the ticket author, but the ticket author can see the guilds that want to accept it.

## Honour

After the task being complete, the user will pass a survey provided by the system, that will puntuate the guilds job. The client has honour too.

## Contracts

When a client accepts a guild, a contract begins. The guild, ingame, needs to assign one responsible to the contract. The two players must sign an ingame contract, using a sentence like "I, [player name], client of ticket number [X] accept to use the services of guild [name], with the responsible [name]". "I, [player name], responsible of guild [name], accepts de client [name] for realizing the ticket number [X]". An screenshot of this must be send into a webpage form.

## Report system

To report a guild or user, is because the work is not done or because the user does not show up. If I am client and I pay a guild for doing this or that, the guild must do it in a week time or so(depends on the ticket and contract). If in time done, the guild has not provided screenshots/video of the work done, and the client reports it, severe actions will be done. 

## Pay system

We want to make the users interaction secure, but, how can we ensure the paying is fair for both sides of the contract? We have some ideas about it. One is classic, 50% at beginning and 50% at final. The other one has some ways of doing it, paying while the task is being done. The client should put a checklist, giving a little reward for every part of the checklist. The payment is done everytime a part of the  checklist is done. What we really want to do is restrict clients. Banning a guild is easy, but banning individual cheaters is not that easy. So we do not want individual cheaters, nor guilds, but with guilds the money will not be lost. 

Maybe a mix of this would be the best option.

## Type of payments

The client can pay to the guild with any sort of object or money, for example, if I need protection because I need to extract T6.2 logs, I am going to give the 50% of the amount extracted to my guardians. I am going to deliver 50% every 10 minutes.
