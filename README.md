# Albion Trade Tickets

A ticket-receiver webpage for users and guilds. Want a bounty guild to hunt your enemy? Want guardians to protect you while gathering? Are you starting a guild oriented in guarding 

## Anti cheat system

This web page will have a list of cheaters (guilds or players), so everyone is going to know if you cheat.

## Anonymous clientele

When a user posts a ticket it will be anonymous until the contract begins. People will not see the ticket author, but the ticket author can see the guilds that want to accept it.

## Honour

After the task being complete, the user will pass a survey provided by the system, that will puntuate the guilds job. The client has honour too.

## Contracts

When a client accepts a guild, a contract begins. The guild, ingame, needs to assign one responsible to the contract. The two players must sign an ingame contract, using a sentence like "I, [player name], client of ticket number [X] accept to use the services of guild [name], with the responsible [name]". "I, [player name], responsible of guild [name], accepts de client [name] for realizing the ticket number [X]". An screenshot of this must be send into a webpage form.
